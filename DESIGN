Description: A simple CRUD database with its own language

Features:
- C like syntax (you heard that right, no more caps lock for writing SQL)
- Remote connection
- Save queries in files and execute them
- Users with tiered access ability

User Interface: 
First the database process will be initialized. After that, clients can connect and query the database via cli or files
			
Technical Design:
- Allocating memory: malloc(), calloc(), and free() will be used.
- Working with files: Read queries from files
- Finding info about files: N/A
- Processes: One master process for the database with client processes that connect to query it
- Signals: Terminate database process through client
- Pipes: Client-database connections
- Shared memory: The semaphore will be in shared memory
- Semaphores: Guaranteed concurrency safety
- Networking: Remote connection to database
- Data Structures: Custom types (time permitting)
- Algorithms: Ability to sort data
